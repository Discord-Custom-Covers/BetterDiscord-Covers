## Request Your Own USRBG

To request your own custom background, follow these steps:

1. Join the [Black Box Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb).
2. Follow the instructions in [#click-here-to-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/).

**Note:** All requests are processed manually by a select few theme developers. Expect a considerable wait time before your background is added.
